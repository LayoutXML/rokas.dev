              Work in progress - An Android launcher application. Currently in alpha stage.
            </p>
            <p>
              A launcher application is an ambitious project which requires a lot of time, effort and knowledge. Therefore it's unclear whether or not this project will ever get published.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I have already done:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Two screens, one of which at the moment is empty (displays only a wallpaper) and another which shows a full list of launcher activities.</li>
              <li><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/projects/applistmanager">Wrote an Android Library just so that I could retrieve these activities!</a> They also auto update.</li>
              <li>Made application list functional - clicking on an application will open that application.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              So if you were to compile and install this project on your Android device - it would work and you would be able to see your applications in an alphabetical order and launch them.
