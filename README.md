* Workarounds for mobile devices and internet explorer, namely:
    * Workaround for mobile devices in landscape that makes Bootstrap's dropdown go off screen.
    * Limiting navbar width for internet explorer that makes Bootstrap's navbar go off screen if it's width is set to 100% (on IE 11).
    * Sticking footer to the bottom of the screen regardless of page (document) height with a workaround for internet explorer (without it, footer would stick to the top of the screen).
* Custom domain and page urls (and without html extensions).
